## Why?

<p align="justify">
There is emerging demand for smart assets and connected digital twins, particularly for critical infrastructure, healthcare and manufacturing. Design and construction teams must be able to deliver complete, accurate and validated asset information to building owners and operators at project handover. 
  
Industy standards such as Construction Operations Building Information Exchange (COBie) and Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) offer a robust foundation upon which to build intelligent systems. Unfortunately, existing techniques used to verify and validate that all required data have been produced to standard are laborious, tedious and error-prone. Moreover, for those whose primary responsibility is to advise Architecture, Engineering & Construction (AEC) professionals on the quality of their structured asset data, automated tools are required that are both performant and reliable.
</p>

## What?

<p align="justify">
The COBie Coach is a free, open-source software solution that helps users to quickly ascertain the quality of their COBie datasets. It also provides helpful <em>coaching</em> advice on how improvements could be made. You'll receive an auto-generated <strong>health check</strong> that details the various metrics and errors analysed during the scan.
</p>

## Get Started

<p align="justify">
  To get started, simply visit <a href="https://www.cobie.coach" target="_blank">The COBie Coach</a> and upload your COBie Excel Workbook.
</p>

## Data Privacy

<p align="justify">
We understand that you may have concerns when uploading sensitive building data to our web application. For this reason, we made the conscious decision to run the entire application <em>client-side</em> only! In practice, this means that your data <strong>never</strong> leaves your device. 
</p>

## Offline-First

<p align="justify">
Since our solution runs entirely on-device, the app remains fully functional even if you're offline. Provided that you've previously loaded the site at least once when connected to the internet, then your browser should have cached the relevant assets, enabling offline scanning. Perfect for when you're out on-site or travelling with poor connectivity!
