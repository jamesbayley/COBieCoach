## Why?

<p align="justify">
There is emerging demand for smart assets and connected digital twins, particularly for critical infrastructure, healthcare and manufacturing projects. Design and construction teams must deliver complete, accurate and validated asset information to building owners and operators at project handover. Whilst, industy standards such as COBie and Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) offer the foundation upon which to build intelligent systems, many of the existing tools used to benchmark COBie data are laborious, tedious and error-prone. For those whose primary responsibility is to advise Architecture, Engineering & Construction (AEC) professionals on asset data quality, we believe they could be better served.
</p>
  
## What?

<p align="justify">
COBie Coach is a free, open-source solution that helps users to quickly ascertain the health of Construction Operations Building Information Exchange (COBie) data, with a focus on transparency, privacy and user experience. After scanning your dataset, you'll receive a bespoke <strong>health check</strong> that scores the key metrics, highlights errors in context, and suggests helpful tips on how to improve. We hope that you'll love using COBie Coach!
</p>

## Getting Started

<p align="justify">
Right now, there's not a lot to see. Once we have something valuable to interact with, we would love for you to visit <a href="https://www.cobie.coach" target="_blank">The COBie Coach</a> and upload your COBie Excel Workbook. In the meantime, be sure to ‚≠ê and <em>watch</em> this repository to keep up-to-date with project developments.
</p>

## Data Privacy

<p align="justify">
We understand that you may have concerns when uploading sensitive building data to our web application. For this reason, we made the conscious decision to run the entire application <em>client-side</em> only! In practice, this means that your data <strong>never</strong> leaves your device. 
</p>
  
## Open-Source

<p align="justify">
This project is built upon the core tenets of trust, transparency and privacy. To help build this trust, we've decided to open-source this entire solution under the <a href="./LICENSE" target="_blank">AGPL-3.0 License</a>. We encourage you to study our source code and offer feedback on how the product can be improved.
